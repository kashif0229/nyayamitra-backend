TRANSFER OF PROPERTY ACT 1882 - SECTION 106: DURATION OF CERTAIN LEASES
In the absence of a contract or local usage to the contrary, a lease of immovable property for agricultural or manufacturing purposes shall be deemed to be a lease from year to year, terminable on the part of either lessor or lessee, by six months' notice. A lease of immovable property for any other purpose shall be deemed to be a lease from month to month, terminable by 15 days notice.

RENT CONTROL ACT - PROTECTION FROM EVICTION
No landlord shall recover possession of any premises let out by him except in execution of a decree of eviction passed by the Rent Control Court. A landlord can only evict a tenant for specific reasons: non-payment of rent, subletting without permission, using premises for illegal purposes, or if landlord requires premises for own use.

RENT CONTROL ACT - STANDARD RENT
The standard rent of any premises shall be the rent payable for such premises. No landlord shall demand or receive any amount over and above the standard rent. Demanding excess rent makes the landlord liable for a fine up to Rs. 5000.

SECURITY DEPOSIT RULES
A landlord cannot demand more than 2 months rent as security deposit in most states. The security deposit must be returned within 30 days of vacating the premises. Wrongful withholding of security deposit makes the landlord liable to pay double the amount withheld.

ILLEGAL EVICTION REMEDY
If a tenant is illegally evicted, they can file a complaint with the Rent Control Authority, approach the Civil Court for injunction to stop eviction, file a police complaint for trespass if landlord forcibly entered, and claim damages for illegal eviction.
